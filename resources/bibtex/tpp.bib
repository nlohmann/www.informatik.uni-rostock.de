This paper presents an automated and effective approach for the verification of information flow control for business process models. Building on the concept of place-based non-interference and declassification, the core contribution of this paper is the application of Petri net reachability to detect places in which information leaks occur. Such a feature allows for the use of state-of-the-art tool support to model-check business process models and detect leaks. We show that the approach is sound and complete, and present the Anica tool to identify leaks. An extensive evaluation comprising over 550 industrial process models is carried out and shows that information flow analysis of process models can be done in milliseconds. This motivates a tight integration of business process modeling and non-interference checking.},

	Abstract = {When outsourcing tasks of a business process to a third party, information flow security becomes a critical issue. In particular implicit information leaks are an intriguing problem. Given a business process one could ask whether the execution of a confidential task is kept secret to a third party which can observe some public (nonconfidential) tasks. A business process is secure in sense of implicit information flow if a third party can not deduce the execution of confidential tasks based on observations of public tasks. We will show that we can verify much faster whether a given process model is secure, support a new information flow property, and support the modeler to create a secure process using a graphical modeling tool. The demo might be interesting for all process modelers and those who are concerned with security in the BPM community.},

	Abstract = {We consider services as units in interorganizational business processes. Following trends in the business process management community, we switch from an activity-centric description of processes to artifact-centric descriptions. In the interorganizational setting, unique problems arise. For instance, an artifact hub that is crucial for present-day enactment of artifact-centric processes, can hardly be shared between different organizations since the stored information may be subject to trade secrets. We propose a solution that involves the translation of an artifact-centric model into an activity-centric model. In this course, we consider artifacts as entities that may be sent around between organizations. The location of an artifact may imply access restrictions for one or the other organization. We propose both a formal model and algorithms to show the effectiveness of our approach.},

	Abstract = {One driver of business process management is the opportunity to reduce costs by outsourcing certain tasks to third-party organizations. At the same time, it is undesirable that delicate information (e. g., trade secrets) ``leak'' to the involved third parties, be it for legal or economic reasons. The absence of such leaks --- called noninterference --- can be checked automatically. Such a check requires an assignment of each task of the business process as either confidential or public. Drawbacks of this method are that (1) this assignment of every task is cumbersome, (2) an unsuccessful check requires a corrected confidentiality assignment although (3) the diagnosis and correction of information leaks is a nontrivial task. This paper presents a modeling prototype that integrates the noninterference check into the early design phase of an interorganizational business process. It not only allows for instant feedback on confidentiality assignments, but also for an automated completion of partial assignments toward guaranteed noninterference.},

@article{Lohmann_2013_is,
	Abstract = {Compliance to legal regulations, internal policies, or best practices is becoming a more and more important aspect in business processes management. Compliance requirements are usually formulated in a set of rules that can be checked during or after the execution of the business process, called compliance by detection. If noncompliant behavior is detected, the business process needs to be redesigned. Alternatively, the rules can be already taken into account while modeling the business process to result in a business process that is compliant by design. This technique has the advantage that a subsequent verification of compliance is not required.

This paper focuses on compliance by design and employs an artifact-centric approach. In this school of thought, business processes are not described as a sequence of tasks to be performed (i.e., imperatively), but from the point of view of the artifacts that are manipulated during the process (i.e., declaratively). We extend the artifact-centric approach to model compliance rules and show how compliant business processes can be synthesized automatically.},

	Abstract = {We call a linear time property simple if counterexamples are accepted by a B{\"u}chi automaton that has only singleton strongly connected components. This class contains interesting properties such as LTL formulas G(φ ⇒ F ψ) or φ U ψ which have not yet received support beyond general LTL preserving approaches.

We contribute a stubborn set approach to simple properties with the following ingredients. First, we decompose the verification problem into finitely many simpler problems that can be independently executed. Second, we propose a stubborn set method for the resulting problems that does neither require cycle detection, nor stuttering invariance, nor existence of transitions that are invisible to all atomic propositions. This means that our approach is applicable in cases where traditional approaches fail. Third, we reduce stubborn set calculation to an integer linear programming problem. The third contribution can be applied to many existing stubborn set methods as well.},

For legal or economic reasons, it might be undesirable that delicate information (e. g., customer data, trade secrets, or financial details) ``leak'' to the involved third parties. The absence of such leaks --- called noninterference --- can be checked automatically. To this end, a model is required in which each task is assessed as either con- fidential or public. A drawback of this method is that (1) this distinction has to be made for each task prior to the verification and that (2) an unsuccessful check requires a new confidentiality assessment followed by another verification step.

This paper introduces a full-automatic technique to complete partial con- fidentiality assessments while guaranteeing noninterference.

	Abstract = {Service-oriented computing proposes services as building blocks which can be composed to complex systems. To reason about the correctness of a service, its communication protocol needs to be analyzed. A fundamental correctness criterion for a service is the existence of a partner service, formalized in the notion of controllability.

In this paper, we introduce Wendy, a Petri net-based tool to synthesize partner services. These partners are valuable artifacts to support the design, validation, verification, and adaptation of services. Furthermore, Wendy can calculate an operating guideline, a characterization of the set of all partners of a service. Operating guidelines can be used in many application scenarios from service brokerage to test case generation. Case studies show that Wendy efficiently performs on industrial service models.

	Abstract = {Variants of the same process can be encountered within one organization or across different organizations. For example, different municipalities, courts, and rental agencies all need to support highly similar processes. In fact, procurement and sales processes can be found in almost any organization. However, despite these similarities, there is also the need to allow for local variations in a controlled manner. Therefore, many academics and practitioners have advocated the use of configurable process models (sometimes referred to as reference models). A configurable process model describes a family of similar process models in a given domain. Such a model can be configured to obtain a specific process model that is subsequently used to handle individual cases, for instance, to process customer orders. Process configuration is notoriously difficult as there may be all kinds of interdependencies between configuration decisions. In fact, an incorrect configuration may lead to behavioral issues such as deadlocks and livelocks. To address this problem, we present a novel verification approach inspired by the ``operating guidelines'' used for partner synthesis. We view the configuration process as an external service, and compute a characterization of all such services which meet particular requirements via the notion of configuration guideline. As a result, we can characterize all feasible configurations (i. e., configurations without behavioral problems) at design time, instead of repeatedly checking each individual configuration while configuring a process model.

	Abstract = {Compliance to legal regulations, internal policies, or best practices is becoming a more and more important aspect in business processes management. Compliance requirements are usually formulated in a set of rules that can be checked during or after the execution of the business process, called compliance by detection. If noncompliant behavior is detected, the business process needs to be redesigned. Alternatively, the rules can be already taken into account while modeling the business process to result in a business process that is compliant by design. This technique has the advantage that a subsequent verification of compliance is not required.

This paper focuses on compliance by design and employs an artifact-centric approach. In this school of thought, business processes are not described as a sequence of tasks to be performed (i. e., imperatively), but from the point of view of the artifacts that are manipulated during the process (i. e., declaratively). We extend the artifact-centric approach to model compliance rules and show how compliant business processes can be synthesized automatically.},

To make a statement about the correctness of a service in isolation, partner synthesis is a proven technique. It overapproximates the service's behavior in any possible composition. Unfortunately, the complexity of partner synthesis is an order of magnitude higher than that of classical model checking techniques. This paper approaches this problem by tackling one source of complexity, namely internal behavior (also called silent or tau-transitions). By applying rules known from compositional verification, we reduce the internal behavior of a service while preserving its external behavior, viz. its communication protocol.},

In essence, we replace the search through the set of reachable states by a search through the space of solutions of the state equation. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the technique on several real-world examples. The technique is particularly useful in those cases where the reachability query yields a negative result: While state space based techniques need to fully expand the state space in this case, our technique often terminates promptly. In addition, we can derive some diagnostic information in case of unreachability while state space methods can only provide witness paths in the case of reachability.},

We checked 735 industrial business process models from financial services, telecommunications, and other domains. We investigated these models for soundness (absence of deadlock and lack of synchronization) using three different approaches: the business process verification tool Woflan, the Petri net model checker LoLA, and a recently developed technique based on SESE decomposition. We evaluate the various techniques used by these approaches in terms of their ability of accelerating the check. Our results show that industrial business process models can be checked in a few milliseconds, which enables tight integration of modeling with control-flow analysis.

@phdthesis{Lohmann_2010_phd,
	Abstract = {Service-oriented computing (SOC) is an emerging paradigm of system design and aims at replacing complex monolithic systems by a composition of interacting systems, called services. A service encapsulates self-contained functionality and offers it over a well-defined, standardized interface.

This modularization may reduce both complexity and cost. At the same time, new challenges arise with the distributed execution of services in dynamic compositions. In particular, the correctness of a service composition depends not only on the local correctness of each participating service, but also on the correct interaction between them. Unlike in a centralized monolithic system, services may change and are not completely controlled by a single party.

We study correctness of services and their composition and investigate how the design of correct service compositions can be systematically supported. We thereby focus on the communication protocol of the service and approach these questions using formal methods and make contributions to three scenarios of SOC.

The correctness of a service composition depends on the correctness of the participating services. To this end, we (1) study correctness criteria which can be expressed and checked with respect to a single service. We validate services against behavioral specifications and verify their satisfaction in any possible service composition. In case a service is incorrect, we provide diagnostic information to locate and fix the error.

In case every participating service of a service composition is correct, their interaction can still introduce problems. We (2) automatically verify correctness of service compositions. We further support the design phase of service compositions and present algorithms to automatically complete partially specified compositions and to fix incorrect compositions.

A service composition can also be derived from a specification, called choreography. A choreography globally specifies the observable behavior of a composition. We (3) present an algorithm to deduce local service descriptions from the choreography which -- by design -- conforms to the specification.

All results have been expressed in terms of a unifying formal model. This not only allows to formally prove correctness, but also makes results independent of the specifics of concrete service description languages. Furthermore, all presented algorithms have been prototypically implemented and validated in experiments based on case studies involving industrial services.},

One of them is finding symmetries, an equivalence relation on places and transitions of a Petri net, and only evaluating one object from each equivalence class. All other objects in the same class are then known to yield the same information. Finding symmetries by brute force is known to be expensive, it is even unclear if it can be done in polynomial time due to the inclusion of the graph isomorphism problem. While a first few symmetries need to be found by brute force, later ones might also be generated. We show how to generate new symmetries from known ones efficiently, how to tell if the brute force algorithm enters a branch not containing symmetries, and how to reduce the symmetries themselves to move towards orthogonality.},

None of these approaches emphasizes the evolution of data involved in the collaboration. In contrast, artifact-centric models pursue the converse strategy and begin with a specification of data objects.

This paper extends existing concepts for artifact-centric business process models with the concepts of agents and locations. By making explicit who is accessing an artifact and where the artifact is located, we are able to automatically generate an interaction model that can serve as a contract between the agents and by construction makes sure that specified global goal states on the involved artifacts are reached.},

	Abstract = {A request to a service registry must be answered with a service that fits in several regards, including semantic compatibility, non-functional compatibility, and interface compatibility. In the case of stateful services, there is the additional need to check behavioral (i.e. protocol) compatibility. This paper is concerned with the latter aspect. An apparant approach to establishing behavioral compatibility would be to apply the well-known technology of model checking to a composition of the provided service and the requesting service. However, this procedure must potentially be repeated for all provided services in the registry which may unprohibitively slow down the response time of the broker. Hence, we propose to insert a preprocessing step. It consists of computing an abstraction of the behavior for each published service that we call communication fingerprint. Upon request, we use the fingerprint to rule out as many as possible incompatible services thus reducing the number of candidates that need to be model checked for behavioral compatibility. The technique is based on linear programming and is thus extremely efficient. We validate our approach on a large set of services that we cut out of real world business processes.},

	Abstract = {Service-oriented computing aims to create complex systems by composing less-complex systems, called services. Since services can be developed independently, the integration of services requires an adaptation mechanism for bridging any incompatibilities. Behavioral adapters aim to adjust the communication between some services to be composed in order to establish proper interaction between them. We present a novel approach for specifying such adapters, based on domain-specific transformation rules that reflect the elementary operations that adapters can perform. We also present a novel way to synthesize complex adapters that adhere to these rules, viz., by consistently separating data and control, and by using existing controller-synthesis algorithms. Our approach has been implemented, and we discuss some example applications, including real business processes in WS-BPEL.},

	Abstract = {A configurable process model describes a family of similar process models in a given domain. Such a model can be configured to obtain a specific process model that is subsequently used to handle individual cases, for instance, to process customer orders. Process configuration is notoriously difficult as there may be all kinds of interdependencies between configuration decisions. In fact, an incorrect configuration may lead to behavioral issues such as deadlocks and livelocks. To address this problem, we present a new verification approach inspired by the "operating guidelines" used for partner synthesis. We view the configuration process as an external service, and compute a characterization of all such services which meet particular requirements via the notion of configuration guideline. As a result, we can characterize all feasible configurations (i. e., configurations without behavioral problems) at design time, instead of repeatedly checking each individual configuration while configuring a process model.},

	Abstract = {A big issue in the paradigm of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) is the service discovery. Enterprises publish their services via the Internet. These published services can then be automatically found and used by other services, meaning, the services are composed. A fundamental property of a service composition is weak termination which guarantees the absence of both deadlocks and livelocks. In principle, weak termination can be verified by inspecting the state space of the composition of (public views of) the involved services.

We propose a methodology to build that state space from pre-computed fragments which are computed upon publishing a service. That way, we shift computation effort from the resource critical 'find' phase to the less critical 'publish' phase. Interestingly, our setting enables state space reduction methods that are intrinsically different from traditional state space reductions. We further show the positive impact of our approach to the computational effort of service discovery.},

A service may be able to interact with a lot of possible partner services, one partner or no partner at all. Having no partner surely is not intended by the designer. But the stateful interaction between services can be formalized and thus analyzed at design time. 

We present a formalization which is centered around a graph data structure that we call interaction graph, which represents feasible runs of a partner service according to the interaction protocol. As interaction graphs suffer from state explosion, we introduce a set of suitable reduction rules to alleviate the complexity of our approach. As our case studies show we are able to analyze the interaction behavior of a service efficiently. },

Many companies distribute their service with the help of web services or integrate other web services into their own workflow. However, before a web service gets published it should be examined well. We will introduce a way of examining the controllability of a web service. That means, we study whether a controller can actually use the functionality provided by the web service. We propose the interaction graph of a web service, that is modelled by an open workflow net. To verify whether such a net is controllable or not it is sufficient to construct a reduced interaction graph. We will define reduction rules that minimize the size of the graph greatly. The analysis using the interaction graph as well as the reduction rules shown in this paper are implemented and have been integrated into an analysis tool kit for web services.},

Nach Studien einiger Forschungsinstitute geht der Trend in der heutigen IT-Branche stark zum Einsatz solcher verteilter Gesch{\"a}ftsprozesse. Es werden Schlagworte wie out-tasking, plug-and-play und Lego-Wirtschaft gepr{\"a}gt. Bevor ein Gesch{\"a}ftsprozess in Form eines Web-Services jedoch ver{\"o}ffentlicht wird, sollte dieser geeignet untersucht werden. Wir werden uns in dieser Arbeit diesem Thema mit Hilfe von Petri-Netz-Modulen n{\"a}hern. Sie modellieren gerade die interne Struktur von Gesch{\"a}ftsprozessen und erm{\"o}glichen es, den Prozess geeignet zu analysieren. Uns interessiert bei der Analyse, ob die Funktionalit{\"a}t, die ein Web-Service bereitstellen soll, auch wirklich genutzt werden kann. Wir sprechen in diesem Zusammenhang von Bedienbarkeit. F{\"u}r die Analyse definieren wir den Interaktionsgraphen eines Workflow-Moduls, welcher die Zust{\"a}nde des Moduls und dessen Interaktion mit einer Umgebung veranschaulicht. Auf dieser Grundlage k{\"o}nnen wir dann eine Bedienstrategie definieren, durch die das Modul bedient werden kann. Das hei¼t, wenn eine Umgebung das Modul so bedienen kann, dass dieses ordentlich terminiert, finden wir eine Bedienstrategie in dem Interaktionsgraphen des Moduls. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus bieten die Graphen dem Modellierer die M{\"o}glichkeit, einen Blick auf die Abl{\"a}ufe seines Moduls zu werfen und genau erkennen zu k{\"o}nnen, welche Zust{\"a}nde des Moduls bei welcher Interaktion mit der Umgebung eingenommen werden. Auf Grundlage dieser Analyse kann der Modellierer seinen Prozess {\"u}berarbeiten, anpassen etc. Um die Bedienbarkeit der Workflow-Module durch den Interaktionsgraphen zu verifizieren, reicht es aus, einen reduzierten Graphen zu konstruieren. Wir werden Reduktionsregeln definieren, die den Nachweis der Bedienbarkeit in den reduzierten Graphen erhalten.

	Abstract = {A configurable process model describes a family of similar process models in a given domain. Such a model can be configured to obtain a specific process model that is subsequently used to handle individual cases, for instance, to process customer orders. Process configuration is notoriously difficult as there may be all kinds of interdependencies between configuration decisions. In fact, an incorrect configuration may lead to behavioral issues such as deadlocks and livelocks. To address this problem, we present a new verification approach inspired by the "operating guidelines" used for partner synthesis. We view the configuration process as an external service, and compute a characterization of all such services which meet particular requirements via the notion of configuration guideline. As a result, we can characterize all feasible configurations (i. e., configurations without behavioral problems) at design time, instead of repeatedly checking each individual configuration while configuring a process model.},

	Abstract = {Service-oriented computing proposes services as building blocks which can be composed to complex systems. To reason about the correctness of a service, its communication protocol needs to be analyzed. A fundamental correctness criterion for a service is the existence of a partner service, formalized in the notion of controllability.

In this paper, we introduce Wendy, a Petri net-based tool to synthesize partner services. These partners are valuable artifacts to support the design, validation, verification, and adaptation of services. Furthermore, Wendy can calculate an operating guideline, a characterization of the set of all partners of a service. Operating guidelines can be used in many application scenarios from service brokerage to test case generation. Case studies show that Wendy efficiently performs on industrial service models.

	Abstract = {Communication is an essential aspect of services. Services do not only realize simple request-response scenarios, but increasingly implement complex and stateful communication protocols. Such a protocol specifies the the order in which messages are sent and received by a service and is an essential part of a service description. Services are usually not executed in isolation, but as a collaboration that is composed of several services. The behavior of such a collaboration is not only determined by the communication protocol of each participating service, but also by the way messages are exchanged. A communication model specifies the properties of the message channels between the service and defines the way how messages are sent and received. This paper studies and classifies several dimensions of communication models and describes their impact to service compositions.},

	Abstract = {Operating guidelines characterize correct interaction (e. g., deadlock freedom) with a service. They can be stored in a service registry. They are typically represented as an annotated transition system where the annotations are Boolean formulae attached to the states.

The core result of this article is to propose an alternative representation of operating guidelines where, instead of a Boolean formula, only a few bits need to be stored with a state. This way, we safe one order of magnitude in the space complexity of the representation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the new representation yields efficiency gains in several algorithms which involve operating guidelines. Finally we show that the new representation permits the translation of the transition system representing the operating guidelines into a Petri net which typically yields further gains concerning the space for storing operating guidelines.},

Feuerungen von Transitionen, nebenl{\"a}ufig sein k{\"o}nnen, und drittens die Pomsetsprache, in deren Pomsets Informationen zur Kausalit{\"a}t enthalten sind. F{\"u}r verschiedene Klassen von Petri-Netzen, so etwa die sicheren und beschr{\"a}nkten Netze, S-Systeme (markierte Graphen) und die Klasse der allgemeinen Petri-Netze (ohne Restriktionen) geben wir algebraische Charakterisierungen {\"u}ber Abschlusseigenschaften f{\"u}r die verschiedenen zugeh{\"o}rigen Sprachklassen an, die jeweils f{\"u}r alle drei Typen von Sprachen uniform sind. Wir unterscheiden weiter zwischen Klassen von Petri-Netzen mit und ohne (unsichtbare) T-Transitionen und mit oder ohne Finalmarkierungen, soweit dies sinnvoll scheint. F{\"u}r die Charakterisierungen {\"u}ber Abschlusseigenschaften geben wir kompositionale Semantiken an, aus deren atomaren (Pomset-, Step-) Sprachen sich die Sprachen von beliebigen Petri-Netzen mittels einiger Operationen (gegen die die jeweilige Sprachklasse abgeschlossen ist) gewinnen lassen. Die notwendigen Abschlusseigenschaften weisen wir z.T. mittels einer neuen Normalform f{\"u}r Petri-Netze nach, die speziell f{\"u}r den Pomsetfall konstruiert wurde. Wir zeigen ferner, dass die Pomsetsprache eines beschr{\"a}nkten Netzes stets auch Pomsetsprache eines sicheren Netzes ist, und dass zu jedem Petri-Netz ein Free-Choice-Netz mit derselben Pomsetsprache existiert. Diese Ergebnisse, wie auch einige der Charakterisierungen, waren bisher nur f{\"u}r den Fall von Sprachen (aus normalen Worten) von Petri-Netzen bekannt. },

	Abstract = {This paper continues a research on universal contexts and semantics for Petri nets started by Nielsen, Priese and Sassone (1995). We consider generalized, labelled Petri nets N where some transitions and places are distinguished as public. They form the interface of N that may communicate with a Petri net context. An elementary calculus, E, is introduced in which one can construct any Petri net with an interface from trivial constants (single places, single transitions) by drawing arcs, adding tokens, and hiding public places and transitions. We prove the existence of a universal context U such that two Petri nets behave the same in any context if their behaviour is equal in the universal context. Let B(U[N]) be the behaviour of N embedded in its universal context, where B may be the interleaving language, step-language, or true-concurrent pomset-language. In any of these cases, B(U[N]) (in contrast to B(N)) turns out to be a compositional semantics of N with respect to the algebra E. In addition, the interleavingand step-semantics are just special cases of the true-concurrency pomset-semantics.},

For long running services, it may even be necessary to change a service while instances are actually running and interacting with other services. This problem is referred to as instance migration. We present a novel approach to the behavioral (service protocol) aspects of instance migration. We apply techniques for finitely characterizing the set of all correctly interacting partners to a given service. The approach assures that migration does not introduce behavioral problems with any running partner of the original service. Our technique scales up to services with thousands of states, including models of real WS-BPEL processes.

It may be used for specification purposes, for instance serving as a contract in the design of an inter-organizational business process. Typically, not all describable interactions make sense which motivates the study of the realizability problem for a given choreography.

In this paper, we show that realizability can be traced back to the problem of controllability which asks whether a service has compatible partner processes. This way of thinking makes algorithms for controllability available for reasoning about realizability. In addition, it suggests alternative definitions for realizability. We discuss several proposals for defining realizability which differ in the degree of coverage of the specified interaction.},

	Abstract = {Compatibility of behavior, i.e. the correct ordering of messages, is one of the core aspects for the interaction between services as parts of an inter-organizational business process. In previous work, we proposed formal representations for service behavior (including Petri nets and service automata) and finite representations of sets thereof (operating guidelines).

In this article, we show how the basic set operations union, intersection, and complement, as well as membership and emptiness tests, can be implemented on finite representations of (typically infinite) sets of services. We motivate the operations by three examples of applications --- service substitution, selection of behavior, and navigation in a behavioral registry.},

New technologies support the development of such systems. However, the paradigm shift towards service orientation, requires a fundamentally different way of looking at processes. This survey aims to provide some foundational notions related to service interaction. A set of service interaction patterns is given to illustrate the challenges in this domain. Moreover, key results are given for three of these challenges: (1) How to expose a service?, (2) How to replace and refine services?, and (3) How to generate service adapters? These challenges will be addressed in a Petri net setting. However, the results extend to other languages used in this domain.},

We checked 735 industrial business process models from financial services, telecommunications and other domains. We checked these models for soundness (absence of deadlock and lack of synchronization) using three different approaches: the business process verification tool Woflan, the Petri net model checker LoLA and a recently developed technique based on SESE decomposition. We evaluate the various techniques utilized by these approaches with respect to their ability of accelerating the check. Our results show that an average industrial business process model can be checked in a few milliseconds, which enables tight integration of modeling with control-flow analysis. We also briefly compare the diagnostic information delivered by the different approaches.},

	Abstract = {Composing services makes sense only if they are compatible, i.e. composition does not lead to problems such as livelocks or deadlocks. In general, compatibility can be checked using state space explorations on any kind of formal models of services.

Petri nets, one of the formal model in use, offer a rich theory for reasoning without exploring a state space. Among the techniques is the so-called state equation which forms a linear algebraic necessary condition for reachability of states.

In this article, we show how the state equation can be applied for a necessary condition for compatibility. This way, the number of expensive state space based compatibility checks can be drastically reduced. The condition can be applied even if compatibility is achieved through the construction of a behavioral adapter (mediator).},

In this paper, we show that realizability can be traced back to the problem of controllability which asks whether a service has compatible partner processes. This way of thinking makes algorithms for controllability available for reasoning about realizability. In addition, it suggests alternative definitions for realizability.

These can be specified in terms of a contract that describes the overall intended process and the duties of all parties involved. We propose to use such a process-oriented contract which can be seen as the composition of the public views of all participating parties. Based on this contract each party may locally implement its part of the contract such that the implementation (the private view) agrees on the contract. In this paper, we propose a formal notion for such process-oriented contracts and give a criterion for accordance between a private view and its public view. The public view of a party can be substituted by a private view if and only if the private view accords with the public view. Using the notion of accordance the overall implemented process is guaranteed to be deadlock-free and it is always possible to terminate properly. In addition, we present a technique for automatically checking our accordance criterion. A case study illustrates how our proposed approach can be used in practice.},

Languages from the second group are preferred by business people but disliked by academic people, and include BPEL, BPMN, and EPCs. These business languages often lack any proper semantics, which often leads to debates on how to interpret certain business models. Nevertheless, business models are used in practice, whereas academic models are hardly used. To be able to use, for example, the abundance of Petri net verification techniques on business models, we need to be able to transform these models to Petri nets. In this paper, we investigate a number of Petri net transformations that already exist. For every transformation, we investigate the transformation itself, the constructs in the business models that are problematic for the transformation and the main applications for the transformation.},

	Abstract = {A precise definition of interaction behavior between services is a prerequisite for successful business-to-business integration. Service choreographies provide a view on message exchanges and their ordering constraints from a global perspective. Assuming message sending and receiving as one atomic step allows to reduce the modelers' effort. As downside, problematic race conditions resulting in deadlocks might appear when realizing the choreography using services that exchange messages asynchronously. This paper presents typical issues when desynchronizing service choreographies. Solutions from practice are discussed and a formal approach based on Petri nets is introduced for identifying desynchronizable choreographies.},

	Abstract = {Controllability for service models is a similar criterion as soundness for workflow models: it establishes a necessary condition for correct behavior of a given service model. Technically, controllability is the problem to decide, for a given service, whether it can interact correctly with at least one other service. Parameters to the problem are the established correctness criterion (e.g. deadlock freedom, livelock freedom, quasi-liveness), the shape of partners (centralized partners versus independently acting partners), or the shape of communication (asynchronous versus synchronous).

In this article, we survey and partly extend various recent results concern- ing the verification of controllability for Petri net based service models. Significant extensions include the study of livelock freedom as correctness criterion as well as the new results on autonomous multi-port controllability.},

We define two important behavioral properties of adaptive workflow nets: soundness and circumspectness. Soundness means that a proper final marking (state) can be reached from any marking which is reachable from the initial marking, and no garbage will be left. Circumspectness means that the upper layer is always ready to handle any exception that can happen in a lower layer. Since adaptive workflow nets can have an infinite state space, we use an abstraction to reduce the problem of verifying soundness and circumspectness to a finite one.},

A typical domain with a great need for this kind of workflow is health care from which domain we choose the running example. To achieve the desired flexibility we allow transitions that create new nets out of the existing ones. Therefore, nets with completely new structure can be created at the run time.

In this paper we consider Extended Event-driven Process Chains (eEPCs), a language which is widely used for modeling business processes, documenting industrial reference models and designing workflows.

We study the value semantics of nested nets rather than the reference semantics, and apply nested nets to model adaptive workflow, i.e. flexible workflow that can be modified during the execution. A typical domain with a great need for this kind of workflow is health care, from which domain we choose the running example. To achieve the desired flexibility we allow transitions that create new nets out of the existing ones. Therefore, nets with completely new structure can be created at the run time. We show that by careful selection of basic operations on the nets we can obtain a powerful modeling formalism that enforces correctness of models. Moreover, the formalism can be implemented based on existing workflow engines.},

We define two important behavioural properties of adaptive workflow nets: soundness and circumspectness. Soundness means that a proper final marking (state) can be reached from any marking which is reachable from the initial marking, and no garbage will be left. Circumspectness means that the upper layer is always ready to handle any exception that can happen in a lower layer. We define a finite state abstraction for adaptive workflow nets and show that soundness and circumspectness can be verified on this abstraction.},

History dependent control offers much more modeling power than classical control structures and it solves several semantical problems of industrial modeling frameworks. We study the modeling power by means of workflow patterns. Since proper completion (i.e. the ability of any configuration reachable from the initial one to reach the final one) is always an important ''sanity check'' of process modeling, we introduce a modeling method that guarantees this property for the new control structures. Finally we consider an implementation of the proposed control structures on top of an existing workflow engine.},

A workflow net is generalized sound iff every marking reachable from an initial marking with k tokens on the initial place terminates properly, i.e. it can reach a marking with k tokens on the final place, for an arbitrary natural number k. Our new decision procedure not only reports whether the net is sound or not, but also returns a counterexample in case the workflow net is not generalized sound. We report on experimental results obtained with the prototype we made and explain how the procedure can be used for the compositional verification of large workflows.},

	Abstract = {WS-BPEL defines a standard for executable processes. Executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an IT infrastructure. The WS-BPEL specification also introduces the concept of abstract processes: In contrast to their executable siblings, abstract processes are not executable and can have parts where business logic is disguised. Nevertheless, the WS-BPEL specification introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-specified abstract process and a fully specified executable one. Basically, this compatibility notion defines a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by profiles. So far, there exist two of such profiles: the Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior and the Abstract Process Profile for Templates. None of these profiles defines a concept of behavioral equivalence. Therefore, both profiles are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one. In this paper, we propose a novel profile that extends the existing Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior by defining a behavioral relationship. We also show that our novel profile allows for more flexibility when deciding whether an executable and an abstract process are compatible.},

On the other hand, BPEL is the de facto standard for describing executable Web service-based business processes. With abstract BPEL processes, BPEL can also be used as modeling language. However, being a complicated language with many syntactic constraints, abstract BPEL processes impede a straightforward modeling.

In this paper, we introduce a fully-automatic translation of Petri net models into abstract BPEL processes which can be refined to executable BPEL processes. This approach combines strengths of Petri nets in modeling and verification with the ability to execute BPEL processes. Furthermore, it completes the Tools4BPEL framework to synthesize BPEL processes which are correct by design.},

	Abstract = {WS-BPEL defines a standard for executable business processes. Executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an IT infrastructure. The WS-BPEL specification also introduces the concept of abstract processes: In contrast to their executable siblings, abstract processes are not executable and can have parts where business logic is disguised. Nevertheless, the WS-BPEL specification introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-specified abstract process and a fully specified executable one. Basically, this compatibility notion defines a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by profiles. So far, there exists two of such profiles: the Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior and the Abstract Process Profile for Templates. None of these profiles defines a concept of behavioral equivalence. Therefore, both profiles are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one. In this paper, we propose a novel profile that extends the existing Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior by defining a behavioral relationship. We also show that our novel profile allows for more flexibility when deciding whether an executable and an abstract process are compatible.},

We present a framework for the calculation of symmetries for several net classes including place-transition nets, timed nets, stochastic nets, self-modifying nets, nets with inhibitor arcs, and many others. Our approach allows the specification of difffierent symmetry groups. Additionally it provides facilities either to calculate symmetries on demand while running the actual analysis algorithm, or to calculate them in advance. For the latter case we define and calculate a ground set of symmetries. Such a set has polynomial size and is sufficient for an efficient implementation of the for all symmetries loop and the partition of net elements into equivalence classes. These two constructions are the usual way to integrate symmetries into an analysis algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Most specific characteristics of (Place/Transition) Petri nets can be traced back to a few basic features including the monotonicity of the enabling condition, the linearity of the firing rule, and the locality of both. These features enable ``Petri net'' analysis techniques such as the invariant calculus, the coverability graph technique, approaches based on unfolding, or structural (such as siphon/trap based) analysis. In addition, most verification techniques developed outside the realm of Petri nets can be applied to Petri nets as well.

In this paper, we want to demonstrate that the basic features of Petri nets do not only lead to additional analysis techniques, but as well to improved implementations of formalism-independent techniques. As an example, we discuss the explicit generation of a state space. We underline our arguments with some experience from the implementation and use of the Petri net based state space tool LoLA.

SOA describe three roles of services, the service provider, the service requester and the service broker, together with the three operations publish, find and bind. We provide a formal method based on non-deterministic automata to model services and their interaction. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to finite and acyclic automata. We suggest operating guidelines as a convenient and intuitive artefact to realise the publish operation. In our approach, the find operation reduces to a matching problem between the requester's service and the published operating guidelines. If matching services are actually bound together, our approach guarantees deadlock-free interaction.

	Abstract = {The text of this book is a dissertation, submitted to Humboldt--University in Berlin. It deals with symbolic analysis methods for algebraic Petri nets. For this kind of high--level nets algebraic specifications are used to describe the individuality of tokens. Though it is possible to specify infinite data types and therefore many standard properties are undecidable for this net class there should be a computer aid for the analysis of algebraic nets.

The formalism of algebraic specifications provides a syntactic framework for symbolic calculations, in particular rewriting techniques for deciding equivalence of descriptions and solving equations. We study how these techniques can be involved in well known Petri net analysis methods, namely invariant calculus and reachability graph construction.

Chapter I introduces the main concepts used in the remaining chapters. It contains a short introduction of algebraic specifications, the definition of algebraic Petri nets and their interpretation.

In chapter II we compare invariant definitions for place transition nets, coloured nets and algebraic nets. Then we investigate the structure of place invariants and transition invariants for algebraic nets and end up in the characterization of small generator sets. We develop an algorithm to enumerate such a generator set. Thereby the calculations are traced back to unification problems. We prove that an algorithm which computes a generator set for all transition invariants cannot always terminate since it is undecidable whether an algebraic net has non--trivial transition invariants or not. We propose simplifications of the analysis problems which allow to circumvent the major computational problems.

In chapter III we take up the idea of parameterized reachability graphs which have been introduced for predicate/transition nets. We translate this method to the formalism of algebraic nets. Thereby we apply several improvements which allow stronger implications between the graph and the behavior of the underlying nets. We present ideas how the stubborn set method can be used to reduce the size of a parametrized reachability graph.

Chapter IV contains examples where we demonstrate our methods and general conclusions. },

Currently, there are no formal methods available to verify BPEL4Chor choreographies. In this paper, we present how BPEL4Chor choreographies can be completely verified using Petri nets. A case study undermines that our verification techniques scale. Additionally, we show how the verification techniques can be used to generate a stub process for a partner taking part in a choreography. This is especially useful when the behavior of one participant is intended to follow the corresponding requirements of the other participants. Thus, the missing participant behavior can be generated and the error-prone design of that participant can be skipped.},

	Abstract = {Service orientation is a means for integrating across diverse systems. Each resource, whether an application, system, or trading partner, can be accessed as a service. The resulting architecture, often referred to as SOA, has been an important enabler for interorganizational processes. Apart from technological issues that need to be addressed, it is important that all parties involved in such processes agree on the "rules of engagement". Therefore, we propose to use a contract that specifies the composition of the public views of all participating parties. Each party may then implement its part of the contract such that the implementation (i.e., the private view) accords with the contract. In this paper, we define a suitable notion of accordance inspired by the asynchronous nature of services. Moreover, we present several transformation rules for incrementally building a private view such that accordance with the contract is guaranteed by construction. These rules include adding internal tasks as well as the reordering of messages and are therefore much more powerful than existing correctness-preserving construction rules.},

The basic idea of SOC, the interaction of services, rises a lot of issues such as proper termination of interacting services or substitution of a service by another one. Such issues can be addressed by means of models of services. We show how services can intelligibly be modeled, and we present algorithms and tools to analyze properties of service models. To make sure that our models properly reflect real world issues of services, we model and investigate services represented in established languages such as WS-BPEL.},

	Abstract = {In many well-known extensions of place-transition nets, including read arcs, inhibitory arcs, reset arcs, priorities and signal arcs, it is sometimes possible to reach a marking through firing a step of transitions which cannot be reached through firing a sequence of single transitions. For state space analysis, it is thus recommendable to consider, in each state, all steps of transitions for firing. Since the number of activated steps may be exponential in the number of transitions, we have, in addition to the well-known state explosion problem, another explosion which we call step explosion. In this paper, we present an approach for alleviating step explosion. We furthermore discuss the joint application of our method with partial order reduction and in the context of CTL model checking.},

                  However, before a web service gets published it should be

	Abstract = {This paper presents two stubborn set methods for alleviating the state explosion problem when reasoning about state properties. The first method makes it possible to determine whether a state of the system is reachable in which a given state predicate holds. The second method makes it possible to determine if from all reachable states it is possible to reach a state where a given state predicate holds. The novelty of the two methods is that they rely on so-called up sets and down sets rather than the notion of visible transitions which causes earlier methods to give only limited reduction of the state space, especially when considering state predicates referring to many of the state variables of the system. The suggested stubborn set methods have been implemented in the LoLA tool, and we report on some experimental results obtained with this computer tool together with some general guidance for applying the two question-guided stubborn set methods and their different implementations in verification. The two methods are presented in the context of Petri Nets, but are applicable also to other state and action oriented modelling formalisms for which the basic stubborn set theory is applicable.},

	Abstract = {The linear algebraic invariant calculus is a powerful technique for the verification of Petri nets. Traditionally it is used for structural verification, i.e. for avoiding the explicit construction of a state space. In this paper, we study the use of Petri net invariants for reducing the memory resources required  during state space construction. While place invariants help to reduce the amount of memory needed for each single state (without reducing the number of states as such), transition invariants can be used to reduce the number of states to be stored. Interestingly, our approach does not require computing invariants in full, let alone storing them permanently. All information we need can be deduced from an upper triangular form of the Petri net's incidence matrix. Experiments prove that the place invariant technique leads to improvements in both memory and run time costs while transition invariants lead to a space/time tradeoff that can be controlled heuristically.},

	Abstract = {Verification is the task of determining whether a (model
                  of a) system holds a given behavioral property. State space
                  verification comprises a class of computer aided
                  verification techniques where the property is verified
                  through exhaustive exploration of the reachable states of
                  the system. Brute force implementations of state space
                  verification are intractable, due to the well known state
                  explosion problem. Explicit state space verification
                  techniques explore the state space one state at a time, and
                  rely usually on data structures where the size of the data
                  structure increases monotonously with an increasing number
                  of explored states. They alleviate state explosion by
                  constructing a reduced state space that, by a
                  mathematically founded construction, behaves like the
                  original system with respect to the specified properties.
                  Thereby, decrease of the number of states in the reduced
                  system is the core issue of a reduction technique thus
                  reducing the amount of memory required. An explicit state
                  space verification technique comprises of - a theory that
                  establishes whether, and how, certain properties can be
                  preserved through a construction of a reduced state space;
                  - a set of procedures to execute the actual construction
                  efficiently. In this thesis, we contribute to several
                  existing explicit state space verification techniques in
                  either of these two respects. We extend the class of
                  stubborn set methods (an instance of partial order
                  reduction) by constructions that preserve previously
                  unsupported classes of properties. Many existing
                  constructions rely on the existence of "invisible" actions,
                  i.e. actions whose effect does not immediately influence
                  the verified property. We propose efficient constructions
                  that can be applied without having such invisible actions,
                  and prove that they preserve reachability properties as
                  well as certain classes of more complex behavioral system
                  properties. This way, so called "global" properties can now
                  be approached with better stubborn set methods. We pick up
                  a graph automorphism based approach to symmetry reduction
                  and propose a set of construction algorithms that make this
                  approach feasible. In difference to established symmetry
                  techniques that rely on special "symmetry creating" data
                  types, a broader range of symmetries can be handled with
                  our approach thus obtaining smaller reduced state spaces.
                  Coverability graph construction leads to a finite
                  representation of an infinite state space of a Petri net by
                  condensing diverging sequences of states to their limit. We
                  prove rules to determine temporal logic properties of the
                  original system from its coverability graph, far beyond the
                  few properties known to be preserved so far. We employ the
                  Petri net concept of linear algebraic invariants for
                  compressing states as well as for leaving states out of
                  explicit storage. Compression uses place invariants for
                  replacing states by smaller fingerprints that still
                  uniquely identify a state (unlike many hash compression
                  techniques). For reducing the number of explicitly stored
                  states, we rely on the capability of Petri net transition
                  invariants to characterize cycles in the state space. For
                  termination of an exhaustive exploration of a finite state
                  space, it is sufficient to cover all cycles with explicitly
                  stored states. Both techniques are easy consequences of
                  well known facts about invariants. As a novel contribution,
                  we observe that both techniques can be applied without
                  computing an explicit representation of (a generating set
                  for) the respective invariants. This speeds up the
                  constructions considerably and saves a significant amount
                  of memory. For all presented techniques, we illustrate
                  their capabilities to reduce the complexity of state space
                  reduction using a few academic benchmark examples. We
                  address compatibility issues, i.e. the possibility to apply
                  techniques in combination, or in connection with different
                  strategies for exploring the reduced state space. We
                  propose a scheme to distribute state space exploration on a
                  cluster of workstations and discuss consequences for using
                  this scheme for state space reduction. We collect
                  observations concerning the impact of the choice of system
                  description formalisms, and property specification
                  languages, on the availability of explicit state space
                  verification techniques.},

	Abstract = {We show that several formulas of a temporal logic can be verified using the coverability graph of the underlying system. Of course, the procedure is not capable of verifying all formulae, since already the reachability problem for (unbounded) Petri nets is computationally hard. Thus, the procedure returns true, false, or unknown for a query. The formulae that can be verified cover most of the well known standard properties which have been listed in the context of coverability graph analysis so far.},

	Abstract = {Commoner's Theorem establishes a relation between siphons, traps and liveness in free choice systems. Most proofs of this theorem do explicitly involve the finiteness of the net. Therefore we cannot apply the theorem directly to high level nets with infinite color domains. We prove generalisations of both the `if' and the `only if' direction to the infinite case which unfortunately cannot be combined to an `iff' statement. We present examples which show that there are both live and non-live nets in the grey zone left by our generalisations. Our approach enlarges the application area of Commoner's theorem to infinite Petri nets, compared with an earlier generalisation to a class of free choice predicate event system, but does not cover the other approach completely.},

We introduce symbolic representations of siphons and traps which work quite well even in infinite cases and are still intuitively readable. The verification of symbolic siphons and traps is traced back to unification and structural induction on the terms. This approach is motivated by some additional considerations. For unification and other proposed structural reasoning mechanisms tool support is given by completeness proof tools studied in the theorem-proving community.},
